Scripts on MTS side:
-------------------------------

crdbm.pl - creates sendrefndx file key - actual ref (f20) + amt +
crididbm.pl  - creates 
dbm.pl (new name FindTrn.pl )- use to fetch target trn using f20+amont+currency
dbmtst.pl (new name BuildTrnIndex.pl) - use to build the index file. Runs after the replay is complete

Sequence of events in ACI reply/compare 
1. Clean up MTS (especially send_ref_ndx)
2. Replay traffic and make sure all is processed
3. Run BuildTrnIndex.pl - creates sndrefndx.pag, sndrefndx.dir 
4. Run compare on the Sim

update localkeys set compexpression='R(?<Id>[_,A-Z,0-9]*)\^*(\,|\^)+'  where tabnameind=2 and cmpkey='description'

teeth night guard - do this

Hi,
My name is Eli Abelski, I am a new member of the EFT Technologies team responsible for communication with current and potential 
customers of EFT.
I know that you expressed some interest in the EFT products before. 
Since that time EFT has improved the product tremendously. 
It would be great if we can get a chance to introduce those enhancement to you.
I would like to  schedulle a video conference so we can explain the new features and remind you about existing ones.
We can discuss how your organization will benifit from the usage of the Simulator (name of the product).

New features ( for your information, you don't have to go into details):
Real time comparison without during regression. There is no need to perform the end of day on MTS in order to
compare the results.
It speeds up the regression testing,
Alows you to replay the traffic from the RGW and perform imediate comparison.
